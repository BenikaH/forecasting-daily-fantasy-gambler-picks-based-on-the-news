the long and short of the code-base - i left out explicit directions for running anything because i wanted to give you a sense first of what's available. i can give you a step-by-step set of command-line commands to run that would furnishing the csvs, models, pickles, etc., as i have them if you want.   




the code PYTHON/model.py does all the player-centered model building (training-validation/testing/writes pickles/summaries/model coeffs)

all of the data it uses comes from  ./DATA/merged/X.merged.csv, where X is 'gpp' or 'dou'

most everything else in the repo exists for the purposes of building ./DATA/merged/merged.csv by merging dataframes from other sources, e.g., sportsdatabase,bbmall monster projections, the 'fictitious gambler' variables, FD historic ownerships (target variable), etc. the work to create all those dfs is in the subdirectories of ./raw/

each of these other mergeable dataframes is placed in ./DATA/mergeable/ after created in the other directories by other manipulations (i can plan on automating that process). 

the code PYTHON/merge.py does the merging of files in ./DATA/mergeable/  . 
the same code with diff. inputs writes a ./DATA/merged/X.proto_merged.csv file (which is used by other .py codes elsewhere to write the individual dataframes eventually merged in ./DATA/merged/X.merged.csv). the above is probably confusing and the result of bad planning. so i'll plan on streamlining this merge step.


i wrote the code PYTHON/predict_contest.py to load the pickled models and predict on the january hold-out. it reads from ./DATA/merged/test.X.merged.csv  and X_MYMODELS/PICKLES/ where X is 'gpp' or 'dou'.


---------------------
the repo's contents-

./PYTHON:
estgrids.py - model parameters. read by model.py
merge.py - does the grand dataframe prep from component csvs. 
model.py - does the modeling, pickling
predict_contest.py - jan holdout predictions,write data

./DATA:
mergeable - has mergeable csvs
merged - has merged csvs from mergeable
parsed_raw - has parsed FD gpp, dou tournament data

./X_MYMODELS:  (X=gpp,dou)
COEFFS - playerwise model coeffs
PICKLES - playerwise compressed models
SUMMARIES - playerwise error stats
cv_PREDS - train/validation predictions
test_PREDS -  test predictions after train/validation hold-out
test_SLATE_PREDS - january hold-out predictions - predicted from january batch

./raw:
FD_RECORDS - raw jsons 
IPslns  - code for generating integer programming solutions for fictitous gambler  variables, eventally merged in ./DATA/merged/merged.csv
